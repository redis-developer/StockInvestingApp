# Stock Investor App 

A stock investing web application built using Django and Redis. 

The app comes with the following functionalities-
1. View all stocks listed on the National Stock Exchange.
2. View the top gainers and losers of today.
3. Buy/Sell stocks (intraday trading available).
4. Every user starts with a balance of 1 lakh Rs.
5. View all of your orders.
6. A portfolio which shows all your stocks, as well as the amount invested in them and the current value.
7. Simplistic color coding to show which investments have been profitable.

## Getting Started

1. Install Django (v>=3.2)
2. Install nsetools
3. Install Postgresql. After basic configuration, create a db called 'investdb', and a user, and grant all privileges to this user for this db. Do the necessary configs in settings.py DATABASES dictionary.
4. Set up Redis.
5. Install Celery.
6. Install django_celery_results and django_celery_beat.
7. Run > python manage.py migrate
8. Create a superuser > python manage.py createsuperuser  (to access the admin panel). 
9. Now Run > python manage.py runserver
10. Open two more terminals and navigate to investpro (the folder containing manage.py)
11. In one, run > celery -A investpro worker -l info 
12. In the second, run > celery -A investpro beat -l info


Redis Commands : 
1. In settings.py


```
 CACHES = {
    "default": {
        "BACKEND": "django_redis.cache.RedisCache",
        "LOCATION": [
            "redis://127.0.0.1:6379/1",
            "redis://127.0.0.1:6379/2",
        ],
        "OPTIONS": {
            "CLIENT_CLASS": "django_redis.client.ShardClient",
        }
    }
}
```

This sets the caching database to redis, and then we can use the django caching tech to directly use redis.

2. After this, we do not need to use Redis commands, but django commands do the needful.

## Storage of data: 
A general framework is - 

```
 cache.set('theKey', theValue, timeout_in_seconds)
```

## Retrieval: 

The general framework is - 

```
 theValue = cache.get('theKey') 
```

These commands are used as per the situation for storage and access of data.

## Architecture - 

We are using the nsetools api to get real time NSE (National Stock Exchage) data. The logic of updating databases on buying and selling of stocks is just basic arithemetic. The real challenge was optimization. Calling the nsetools api everytime for relevant data bottlenecked the system and accounted for nearly 100% of the delay. This happened when calling for the following data - top movers data and current stock prices, which means, the two most relevant pages, top_movers, and portfolio took too much time to load (30-40 seconds). 

We have used Redis as the caching tech, and instead of calling the data from the api over and over again, we cached them for a set time, thereby calling it from the database, which is much faster. One problem still remained, that once it is cached, it loads again in no time, but for the first time, it has to pull the data from the api. So I used Celery to set up a periodic task to fetch stock prices in the current user's portfolio every 15 seconds. Hence, when the user opens the portfolio page, it's likely to load instantly which is a massive upgrade, and maximum delay from the live price would be only 15 seconds. This is how I used caching to optimize the app to be exponentially faster than before.
